# Cloning-LinkedIn
A project where we cloned LinkedIn.
This project marked our venture in the second semester, proving to be remarkably intricate yet functioning with an almost magical quality. It is solely console-based and exclusively utilizes the C++ language.

**Objective**:
Our aim was to craft a project that vividly illustrates the tenets of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), namely Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

**Pursuit**:
To materialize the aforementioned OOP concepts, we discerned no superior playground than LinkedIn. Thus, we embarked on the ambitious journey of replicating its functionalities to the fullest extent possible—a task that truly proved to be a challenge.

**Attainment**:
After dedicated months of refining different drafts and persistently iterating, we finally arrived at the culmination—the ultimate LinkedIn clone. As we had envisioned, it not only emulated the fundamental functionalities but also delved into the intricacies, such as company tracking, immersive employment experiences, job applications, curated daily news feeds, job postings, fostering connections, and facilitating real-time messaging.

**Outcome**:
The toil and dedication invested bore fruit, with our project once again meriting a flawless score of 10/10. Beyond the academic achievement, this project brought a profound realization: the practical value of OOP principles in the professional world. It dawned upon us how industries and companies, those we aspire to be a part of one day, ingeniously employ OOP to devise efficient solutions for everyday challenges.
